# SENG2200_A2

## Objective

The objective for this assignment was to implement my understanding of interfaces, polymorphism,
generics, and iterators.

## Problem Statement

The firm in Denman still believes that data structures that are hand-coded will run faster than
those used from the Java libraries, and so this is still required for your container types. However,
once the true nature of generic structures was explained to them, they have decided that containers
will use generic specifications and standard iterator interfaces

## Compile

`javac A2.java`

## Run

`java A2 <filename> -d <output-directory>`
